# L-voice-filter
L is a famous character from the goat anime Death Note. As he is a detective in the anime, he occasionally uses a voice filter for anonymous calls. I made a python code to re-create that filter.

You need to install an additional systemwide dependency. 

sudo pip install libsndfile
